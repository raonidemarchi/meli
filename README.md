## Development

*Make sure to have [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and
[Node](http://nodejs.org/) installed.*

2. Once you have your local copy, install its dependencies:

    ```sh
    $ npm install
    ```

3. Install [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/):

    ```sh
    $ npm install gulp -g
    ```

4. Install [Nodemo](https://nodemon.io/):

    ```sh
    $ npm install nodemon -g
    ```

3. Run the `dev` script:
